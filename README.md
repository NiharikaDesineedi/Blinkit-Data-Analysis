The goal is to derive meaningful insights into Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, inventory, and distribution, ultimately providing actionable intelligence to the business. This analysis is designed to be a valuable learning experience for data analysts and SQL/Python/Excel learners alike, serving as a robust portfolio project.

## Problem Statement & Business Objectives
Blinkit, an Indian online grocery and quick commerce application by Zomato, delivers items instantly to customers' doorsteps. The core business objective is to conduct a **comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance** to understand key trends, identify areas of improvement, and make data-driven decisions. This project aims to assess how the business is performing at both high-level summaries (KPIs) and granular levels (charts), identifying factors driving growth or decline.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
At a high level, the management assesses business performance through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to determine profitability and strategic direction. The project focuses on deriving four crucial KPIs:

*   **Total Sales:** The overall revenue generated from all sold items across the entire dataset.
    *   *Example Value (from SQL analysis):* Approximately **$1.20 million**.
*   **Average Sales per Order:** The average revenue generated from each customer order.
    *   *Example Value (from SQL analysis):* Approximately **$141**.
*   **Number of Items Sold:** The total count of individual items sold within the given period. Each row in the dataset represents a single item sold.
    *   *Example Value (from SQL analysis):* **8,523 items**.
*   **Average Customer Rating:** The average rating provided by customers for the purchased products and service. This metric is crucial for new customer attraction and product validation.
    *   *Example Value (from SQL analysis):* **3.97 (or 4.0 when rounded)**.

## Granular Analysis & Chart Requirements
To deep dive into the data and identify root causes or specific performance areas, the analysis includes detailed charting requirements:

*   **Total Sales by Fat Content:** Analyze sales and other metrics (average sales, number of items, average ratings) based on the fat content (e.g., Low Fat, Regular) of items.
    *   *Chart Type:* **Donut Chart**.
*   **Total Sales by Item Type:** Evaluate sales and other metrics for different item categories (e.g., Fruits, Frozen Foods, Soft Drinks, Household Products).
    *   *Chart Type:* **Bar Chart**.
*   **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:** Compare sales performance across different outlets based on fat content, using additional metrics. Blinkit operates multiple stores in different pin codes for quick delivery.
    *   *Chart Type:* **Clustered Bar Chart** or Stacked Column Chart.
*   **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year:** Analyze sales performance based on the year an outlet was established. New outlets are opened as demand increases.
    *   *Chart Type:* **Line Chart**.
*   **Sales by Outlet Size:** Determine sales performance based on the size of the outlet (e.g., High, Medium, Small).
    *   *Chart Type:* **Donut Chart**.
*   **Sales by Outlet Location Type:** Assess sales distribution based on outlet's geographical location (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities).
    *   *Chart Type:* **Funnel Chart** or Bar Chart.
*   **All Metrics by Outlet Type:** Visualize various metrics (total sales, average sales, number of items, average ratings) for different outlet types (e.g., Supermarket Type 1, Grocery Store).
    *   *Chart Type:* **Matrix Card** (in Power BI/Excel) or grouped bar charts (in Python/SQL).

## Key Insights & Business Recommendations
Through this multi-tool analysis, several key insights can be derived, leading to actionable business recommendations:

*   **Low Fat Content Drives Sales:** Products with low fat content consistently contribute to the highest sales and order volumes. This suggests a market preference for healthier options.
*   **Fruits & Vegetables Lead Sales:** Fruits and vegetables are the best-selling item type, followed by snacks and household items.
*   **Medium-Sized Outlets Outperform High-Sized:** Medium-sized outlets generate the highest sales percentage (42%), while high-sized outlets contribute the least (20%). This indicates that focusing on strategically located medium-sized stores might be more efficient than large, high-end outlets, potentially converting a single high-sized store into two medium ones to serve more locations.
*   **Tier 3 Locations Lead Sales:** Tier 3 locations generate the maximum sales (39%), followed by Tier 2 (32%) and Tier 1 (28%). This highlights strong market penetration or demand in less urbanized areas.
*   **Outlet Establishment Year Performance:** Stores established in 2018 show high sales performance, and even recently opened stores (e.g., 2022) demonstrate good sales, suggesting effective new market capturing.
*   **Supermarket Type 1 Dominance:** Supermarket Type 1 outlets account for the majority of sales (65%), indicating their primary role in Blinkit's operations. Grocery stores, often found in Tier 3 cities, contribute a smaller but significant portion.
*   **Average Rating Improvement:** The overall average rating of 3.97 (or 4.0) suggests there is room for improvement in product quality, delivery time, or overall service to enhance customer satisfaction.
